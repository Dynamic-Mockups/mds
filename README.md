# Claude Code Workflows for Design System Development

This repo contains two workflow guides for building production-ready React components using Claude Code as the primary development tool.

**[design-system-workflow.md](./design-system-workflow.md)** covers building design system components directly from Figma designs using Figma MCP + Storybook MCP connected to Claude Code. It includes MCP setup, CLAUDE.md configuration with Radix UI rules, and a full component generation example with Storybook stories.

**[lovable-to-app-workflow.md](./lovable-to-app-workflow.md)** covers implementing features from Lovable prototypes into your existing React app — no designer or Figma needed. Your colleague builds a prototype in Lovable, syncs it to GitHub, and you use Claude Code to translate the Lovable code (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) into your app's architecture (Radix UI + design tokens).
